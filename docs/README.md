# Autobiography

My is Smith Hu, From New Taipei City, Taiwan. I graduated from TAMKANG University and my major was in Electrical Engineering.
Concentrating on 3X3 matrix VLSI design on University last year, I instereted digital IC design.
Managing around 140 soilders in a company, learning team play, coordinating skill with cross companies,
I was a lieutenant in army during 4 years volunteer service.

In past working experience, I involved TV product manufacture and mulit-channles sound bar on real-time os or embeded linux.
Especially, mulit-channles sound bar is my system intergration milestone. Collectiing customer functionality requirements, surveying micro processor,
real-time os, bare-metel programming with USB pen driver, outputting PCM from micro processor, controlling more common connectivitiy deivces,
infrared remote controller menu tree specification, I established the project from zero.
Intergrating these hardware devices(e.g UI indicators, HDMI reapter, CEC and HDCP, audio DSP, SPI storage...etc), managing memory resource,
I contructed system architecture with free rtos task scheduler, mutex and message queue in ARM cortex-M3/M4.
The mulit-channles sound bar got best home theater award that extermely encourages me in 2012.
