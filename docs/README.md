My name is Smith Hu, From New Taipei City, Taiwan. I graduated from TAMKANG University and my major was in Electrical Engineering.
I interested digital IC design. Therefore, I concentrated on 3x3 matrix small project with Verilog on University last year.
Due to the project precious experience, I start a firmware engineer career.
In addition to studying period, I had serviced in army for 4 years; the duration I managed around 140 soldiers,
learning team play, coordinating with cross companies, figuring out to finish tasks any way.

I am presently working as staff firmware engineer at CYWEE MOTION that is a solution company. Our ASIC is real-time service processor and applies on wearable device
that samples accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, heart rate, air pressure, temperature, humidity sensors precisely, and can be combined with
Android, RTOS SOCs. The ASIC major purpose is used to human health, human activity recognition, orientation, environment sense
and saving SOC power consumption. My responsibility is following customer's requirement to integrate algorithm, particular MEMS sensor, consumption turning
and bug fixing. I usually debug issue with logical analyzer, JTAG, digital power meter for program issue, sensor driver and power consumption.
Especially, ASIC power consumption turning is not easy; I measure program execution time includes content switching, getting sensor data, algorithm
processing via GPIO, and consider program performance. Our ASIC current consumption is between 0.4 and 0.7mA.

In past working experience, I involved TV product manufacture and mulit-channles sound bar on real-time os or embedded linux.
Especially, mulit-channles sound bar is my system integration milestone. Collecting customer functionality requirements, surveying microprocessor,
real-time os, bare-metal programming with USB pen driver, outputting PCM from microprocessor, controlling more common connectivity deivces,
Infrared remote controller menu tree specification, I established the project from zero.
Integrating these hardware devices (e.g. UI indicators, HDMI repeator , CEC and HDCP, audio DSP, SPI storage...etc.), managing memory resource,
I constructed system architecture with free rtos task scheduler, mutex and message queue in ARM cortex-M3/M4.
The mulit-channles sound bar got best home theater award that extremely encourages me in 2012.

I have been at my company for three years now and have learned a lot from working with some amazing engineer.
In my free time, I improve Linux shell, kernel driver and play Raspberry PI 3; I wish I am able to involve embedded Linux
development in the future. However, I am starting to feel like I need some new challenges.
