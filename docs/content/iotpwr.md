## IOT Product Power Consumption Tuning

## Key Points
+ Physical sensors powered control.
+ Physical sensors accessing time(hardware interruption/spi/i2c)
+ Microcontroller processing time.

## IOT Product hardware architecture
+ Illstruted...

## Turning Method
+ Power Meter
<br>1. Monitored physical sensors current consumption.
<br>2. Monitored microcontroller current consumption.
+ Logical analyzer
<br>1. Microcontroller sleeping and active duration.
